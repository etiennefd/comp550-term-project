Usage instructions:

python ./source/classifier.py skip_gram > ./results/your_output_name.txt
python ./source/classifier.py func_word > ./results/your_output_name.txt

this script will use the feature set specified by the command-line argument to attempt to classify the authors for segmented chunks of text in the ./data/ folder.

Results will be saved in the ./results/ folder, with a time-stamped filename. 

To be implemented: combine multiple features via the commmand line.
